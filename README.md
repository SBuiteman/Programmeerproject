Summary: This application allows users to make their own personal workouts which are shown in a weekly schedule.
Exercises in the workouts can be viewed along with the chosen sets, reps, weight and instruction. Users create
an exercise by choosing a name and day and then add exercises to that workout. Workouts can later be added or 
removed. The app is meant to help people with little expience decide on exercises and create workouts and also
provides information on how to perform the exercises. The data is retrieved from an API wger.de and then stored
using an SQLite database.
